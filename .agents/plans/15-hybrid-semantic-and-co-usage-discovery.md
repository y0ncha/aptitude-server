# Plan 15 - Hybrid Semantic Retrieval and Co-Usage Discovery Signals

## Goal
Add a post-launch semantic candidate-expansion layer to `POST /discovery`
using PostgreSQL `pgvector`, while also introducing a bounded statistical
signal for "commonly used together" skills that can improve advisory ranking
without changing the server/resolver boundary or the frozen public route set.

## Positioning
This milestone is post-launch and optional. It is not part of MVP readiness,
read-contract reset, contract freeze, release hardening, or auth-boundary work.

This plan extracts a concrete implementation path from the broader optional
discovery bucket: semantic retrieval and co-usage ranking signals should be
implemented here rather than folded loosely into generic evaluation work.

## Relationship to Earlier Plans

### Builds On Implemented Plans
- Plan 05 established the lexical `skill_search_documents` read model and the
  rule that discovery remains metadata-centric and body-free.
- Plan 08 finalized PostgreSQL as the only runtime store and kept discovery off
  raw content rows by default.
- Plan 09 froze the public route set and the rule that discovery stays inside
  `POST /discovery`.
- Plan 10 finalized governance expectations that discovery must respect
  lifecycle and trust filtering inside the server.

### What This Plan Overwrites or Supersedes
- It overwrites the implicit assumption from the lexical-search milestone that
  `skill_search_documents` is the only discovery retrieval model. After this
  plan, lexical search remains the baseline but no longer the only candidate
  source.
- It supersedes any post-Plan-05 reading that discovery ranking is purely
  `tsvector`-based. Ranking becomes hybrid lexical plus semantic, with optional
  bounded co-usage boosts, while preserving exact-match precedence and
  deterministic tie-breakers.
- It extends the PostgreSQL-only storage direction from Plan 08 by adding new
  derived PostgreSQL read models such as `skill_search_embeddings` and
  co-usage aggregates. It does not reopen the decision to keep PostgreSQL as the
  only runtime store.
- It preserves the Plan 09 route freeze and explicitly rejects any alternative
  interpretation that semantic search requires a sibling route, debug route, or
  public vector-score API.
- It preserves the governance rules from Plans 06 and 10 but overwrites any
  interpretation that governance only applies to lexical retrieval; the same
  policy filters must apply to semantic and co-usage-enhanced discovery.
- It does not overwrite canonical dependency semantics. Co-usage signals are
  advisory and must not replace authored dependency declarations or exact
  resolution behavior from earlier implemented plans.

## Stack Alignment
- Runtime: Python 3.12+
- API and contracts: FastAPI + Pydantic v2
- Data layer: SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic
- Database: PostgreSQL as the only authoritative runtime store
- Vector indexing: PostgreSQL `pgvector`
- Background execution: APScheduler for low-volume indexing, with queue-backed
  workers only if observed scale requires it

## Recommended Architecture
- Keep lexical retrieval from `skill_search_documents` as the always-on
  baseline.
- Add semantic retrieval as a second, additive, best-effort candidate source.
- Keep embeddings in a separate derived table so lexical and semantic indexing
  can evolve independently.
- Generate embeddings asynchronously after publish commit so immutable publish
  success never depends on model-service availability.
- Keep statistical co-usage signals derived and rebuildable. They must inform
  candidate ranking only and must never become a canonical dependency source.
- Do not implement agentic or LLM-driven traversal in the server request path.
  Discovery must remain data-local, bounded, auditable, and deterministic under
  fallback.

## Scope
- Add a `pgvector`-backed semantic retrieval layer for `POST /discovery`.
- Keep semantic retrieval metadata-centric by embedding:
  - `slug`
  - `name`
  - `description`
  - `tags`
  - `rendered_summary`
- Keep `raw_markdown` out of the first semantic-search version.
- Add a new derived read model, recommended as `skill_search_embeddings`, with:
  - `skill_version_fk`
  - `embedding_model`
  - `embedding_dimensions`
  - `source_checksum_digest`
  - `embedding_vector`
  - `index_status`
  - `indexed_at`
  - `created_at`
  - `last_error`
- Add deterministic hybrid retrieval flow:
  - lexical retrieval
  - semantic retrieval
  - candidate union
  - deterministic fusion
  - per-slug collapse
  - final ordering and limit
- Use Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to combine lexical and semantic candidate
  ranks instead of comparing raw cosine distance directly with lexical scores.
- Keep exact slug match and exact name match above fused semantic relevance.
- Add a derived co-usage statistics layer for skills that are commonly used
  together.
- Model co-usage as advisory relationship strength, not as a replacement for
  authored dependency declarations.
- Keep all semantic and co-usage improvements inside `POST /discovery` and the
  existing discovery internals; do not add new public discovery route families.

## Non-Goals
- No new public semantic-search route.
- No server-side final selection, reranking policy ownership, solving, lock
  generation, or execution planning.
- No agent-based search or internal LLM traversal in the discovery request path.
- No embedding of full markdown bodies in the first version.
- No requirement that semantic retrieval be available for discovery to succeed.
- No treatment of co-usage statistics as authoritative install, dependency, or
  compatibility data.

## Semantic Retrieval Design

### Retrieval Shape
- `POST /discovery` continues to accept the existing request shape by default.
- Query normalization remains the current lexical normalization path.
- If query text is empty, skip semantic retrieval.
- If semantic retrieval is enabled and query text exists:
  - generate one query embedding under a strict timeout budget
  - fetch top semantic candidates from `skill_search_embeddings`
  - union those candidates with lexical results
  - apply deterministic fusion and existing tie-breakers
- Lexical retrieval remains mandatory.
- Semantic retrieval is best-effort and must degrade cleanly to lexical-only
  behavior.

### Ranking Rules
Recommended fused ordering:
1. exact slug match
2. exact name match
3. `rrf_score`
4. `tag_overlap_count`
5. `usage_count`
6. newer `published_at`
7. smaller `content_size_bytes`
8. lexical `slug`
9. higher internal version id

### Filtering and Governance
- Semantic retrieval must honor the same server-enforced filters as lexical
  search:
  - lifecycle visibility
  - trust tier
  - freshness window
  - max content size
  - required tags
- Forbidden candidates must not be admitted by semantic retrieval and merely
  pruned later in Python.
- If ANN behavior performs poorly under selective filters, over-fetch
  candidates inside a governance-safe SQL path and then apply deterministic
  ranking over the eligible subset.

## Co-Usage Statistics Design

### Recommendation
Add a separate derived statistics pipeline for skills that are commonly used
together. This should be a ranking signal, not an independent retrieval source
in the first version.

### Data Model Direction
Recommended derived tables:

- `skill_usage_observations`
  - append-only or replayable observation log
  - source examples: resolver lock snapshots, curated bundle exports, or other
    explicit post-selection signals
  - must not be inferred from arbitrary browsing or discovery clicks alone

- `skill_co_usage_pairs`
  - `anchor_skill_fk`
  - `related_skill_fk`
  - `observation_count`
  - `distinct_run_count`
  - `co_usage_rate`
  - `lift_score`
  - `pmi_score` or another association-strength metric
  - `last_observed_at`
  - `window_days`
  - `created_at`
  - `updated_at`

The exact metric can be finalized during implementation, but it should reward
true association strength rather than raw popularity alone.

### Recommended Source of Truth
- Keep canonical dependency declarations in the existing normalized dependency
  model.
- Keep co-usage observations derived from explicit consumer outcomes, ideally
  resolver-produced lock or selected-bundle facts.
- If no high-quality outcome feed exists yet, defer co-usage boosting rather
  than approximating it from noisy page-view or discovery-request data.

### Ranking Use
- Apply co-usage only as a bounded boost after lexical and semantic candidates
  are already assembled.
- Prefer using co-usage when the caller provides meaningful context, such as:
  - already selected skills
  - installed skills
  - explicit task bundle context
- If discovery remains context-free, co-usage should stay off or be limited to a
  conservative tie-break role.
- Co-usage must never outrank exact identifier matches on its own.
- Co-usage boosts must be capped to prevent popularity loops from dominating
  semantic relevance.

## Component Boundaries
- `app/intelligence/`
  - embedding source-text construction
  - source checksum helpers
  - RRF fusion helpers
  - co-usage score-combination helpers
- `app/core/`
  - hybrid discovery orchestration
  - fallback behavior
  - latency budgeting
  - feature-flag and rollout rules
- `app/persistence/`
  - `pgvector` model and ANN query support
  - co-usage aggregate models and queries
  - governance-safe filtered retrieval
- background worker
  - embedding generation
  - reindex and retry workflows
  - co-usage aggregate rebuilds or incremental refreshes

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 0 - Instrumentation
- Measure lexical miss and weak-recall cases in discovery.
- Establish latency and recall targets before changing ranking behavior.
- Define the minimum viable quality bar for semantic and co-usage boosts.

### Phase 1 - Semantic Schema and Indexing
- Add `pgvector` migration and `skill_search_embeddings`.
- Add metadata-centric source-text builder plus source checksumming.
- Add post-commit embedding indexing and retry behavior.

### Phase 2 - Dark Launch
- Backfill embeddings for existing published versions.
- Generate query embeddings in shadow mode.
- Log semantic overlap with lexical results without changing responses.

### Phase 3 - Hybrid Retrieval
- Enable lexical + semantic union under a feature flag.
- Roll out RRF fusion on a controlled traffic slice.
- Benchmark latency, recall, and candidate stability.

### Phase 4 - Co-Usage Signals
- Introduce co-usage observation ingestion from explicit outcome sources.
- Build `skill_co_usage_pairs` aggregates.
- Apply capped co-usage boosts only where context quality justifies it.

### Phase 5 - Hardening
- Add rebuild tooling for embedding-model changes.
- Add metrics, lag alerts, and failure dashboards for indexing pipelines.
- Freeze the first supported embedding model and co-usage metric version.

## Deliverables
- Migration plan for PostgreSQL `pgvector` enablement and
  `skill_search_embeddings`.
- Discovery design note describing hybrid lexical + semantic retrieval and
  deterministic fusion.
- Derived co-usage signal design note with event source, aggregation method, and
  bounded ranking impact.
- Repository and service changes scoped to the existing discovery route family.
- Reindex and backfill tooling for embeddings and co-usage aggregates.
- Feature-flag strategy for dark launch and staged rollout.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `POST /discovery` continues to work when embeddings are unavailable, stale, or
  timing out.
- Semantic retrieval never blocks immutable publish success.
- Semantic ranking is additive and keeps exact slug/name matches ahead of fused
  relevance.
- No new public semantic-search or statistical-discovery route family is added.
- Governance filters are enforced consistently across lexical and semantic
  retrieval paths.
- Co-usage signals remain advisory and derived; they do not mutate canonical
  dependency, metadata, or content records.
- Co-usage boosts are context-aware and capped so they cannot dominate exact
  matches or overwhelm semantic and lexical relevance.
- The server/resolver boundary remains unchanged: the server expands candidates,
  while final selection and runtime policy remain resolver-owned.

## Test Plan
- Unit tests for embedding source normalization and source checksum behavior.
- Unit tests for RRF fusion ordering and deterministic tie-breaks.
- Unit tests for co-usage score normalization, capping, and fallback behavior.
- Integration tests for lexical-only fallback when embeddings are unavailable.
- Integration tests for governance-safe semantic retrieval under lifecycle and
  trust filters.
- Integration tests for per-slug collapse with hybrid candidates.
- Migration tests for embedding backfill on historical published versions.
- Migration or persistence tests for co-usage aggregate rebuilds.
- Performance tests for discovery p95 under lexical-only, dark-launch, and
  hybrid modes.
- Regression tests proving exact fetch and dependency-resolution behavior remain
  independent of semantic and co-usage state.

## Open Design Questions
- Whether `POST /discovery` should gain an optional caller-context field such as
  `context_skills` for high-quality co-usage boosts, or whether the first
  co-usage version should stay purely internal and conservative.
- Which explicit outcome feed should be the canonical input for co-usage:
  resolver lock snapshots, curated bundle exports, or another bounded source.
- Which ANN index type and vector distance function perform best on the target
  PostgreSQL deployment.
- Whether hot query embedding caching is needed after initial latency
  measurement.

## Recommendation Summary
- Implement semantic search with `pgvector`, not agent traversal.
- Keep lexical retrieval as the baseline and semantic retrieval as additive.
- Keep semantic indexing asynchronous and rebuildable.
- Add co-usage as a bounded statistical ranking signal only after a trustworthy
  explicit outcome feed exists.
- Preserve the discovery contract and keep all new logic inside the current
  server boundary.
