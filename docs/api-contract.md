# API Contract

Human-readable summary of the public HTTP API implemented by `aptitude-server`.
For interactive local API docs, use `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## Boundary

This API is intentionally registry-first.

- Server-owned: immutable publish, candidate discovery, exact dependency reads, exact immutable fetch, lifecycle governance, and audit.
- Client-owned: prompt interpretation, reranking, final selection, dependency solving, lock generation, and execution planning.

Public routes:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`
- `POST /skill-versions`
- `POST /discovery`
- `GET /resolution/{slug}/{version}`
- `GET /skills/{slug}/versions/{version}`
- `GET /skills/{slug}/versions/{version}/content`
- `PATCH /skills/{slug}/versions/{version}/status`

## Auth And Errors

- `GET /healthz` and `GET /readyz` are unauthenticated.
- All other routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Required scopes:
  - `read`: discovery, resolution, fetch
  - `publish`: immutable publish
  - `admin`: lifecycle updates and admin-only governance behavior

All JSON errors use:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "Request validation failed.",
    "details": {
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

Common codes:

- `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED`
- `INVALID_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE`
- `SKILL_VERSION_NOT_FOUND`
- `POLICY_*`

## Core Shapes

Exact immutable coordinates use:

```json
{
  "slug": "python.lint",
  "version": "1.2.3"
}
```

Publish and exact metadata fetch return the same immutable metadata envelope:

```json
{
  "slug": "python.lint",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "version_checksum": {"algorithm": "sha256", "digest": "..."},
  "content": {
    "checksum": {"algorithm": "sha256", "digest": "..."},
    "size_bytes": 123,
    "rendered_summary": "Lint Python files consistently."
  },
  "metadata": {
    "name": "Python Lint",
    "description": "Linting skill",
    "tags": ["python", "lint"]
  },
  "lifecycle_status": "published",
  "trust_tier": "internal",
  "provenance": {
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/example/skills",
    "commit_sha": "aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899aabbccdd",
    "tree_path": "skills/python.lint"
  },
  "published_at": "2026-03-10T08:30:00Z"
}
```

## Route Semantics

### `POST /discovery`

Request:

```json
{
  "name": "Python Lint",
  "description": "Lint Python files consistently",
  "tags": ["python", "lint"]
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "candidates": ["python.lint", "python.format"]
}
```

Rules:

- Discovery is candidate generation only.
- It returns ordered `slug` values, not cards or versions.
- It does not choose a final candidate.
- It does not solve dependencies.
- Default governance visibility is `published` only.

### `GET /resolution/{slug}/{version}`

Response:

```json
{
  "slug": "python.lint",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "depends_on": [
    {
      "slug": "python.base",
      "version_constraint": ">=1.0.0,<2.0.0",
      "optional": true,
      "markers": ["linux", "gpu"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:

- Exact read only, not search.
- Returns direct authored `depends_on` selectors only.
- No recursion, solving, or transitive expansion.
- No `extends`, `conflicts_with`, or `overlaps_with` in the response.

### `GET /skills/{slug}/versions/{version}`

Returns the immutable metadata envelope for one exact coordinate.

Rules:

- Exact read only, not search.
- Returns the same metadata envelope shape as publish.
- Missing coordinates return `404`.
- Read policy matches exact resolution rules: `published` and `deprecated` are readable with `read`; `archived` is admin-only.

### `GET /skills/{slug}/versions/{version}/content`

Returns the immutable markdown body for one exact coordinate as
`text/markdown; charset=utf-8`.

Success headers include:

- `ETag`
- `Cache-Control: public, immutable`
- `Content-Length`

Rules:

- Exact read only, not search.
- Missing coordinates return `404`.
- The body is the raw stored markdown; metadata stays on the metadata route.
- Read policy matches the metadata exact-read route.

### `POST /skill-versions`

Publishes one immutable `slug@version` with:

- markdown content
- structured metadata
- governance metadata
- authored relationships

Notes:

- `depends_on` items must provide exactly one of `version` or `version_constraint`.
- `internal` publish requires provenance.
- `verified` publish requires provenance and `admin`.
- Success returns metadata only, not embedded markdown or relationship graphs.

### `PATCH /skills/{slug}/versions/{version}/status`

Transitions one immutable version between `published`, `deprecated`, and
`archived`.

Notes:

- Requires `admin`.
- Read callers can read `published` and `deprecated`.
- `archived` exact reads are admin-only.

## Discovery, Resolution, And Fetch On The Server

The implementation is split into a thin FastAPI interface layer, small core
services, and one SQLAlchemy repository adapter backed by PostgreSQL.

### Startup Wiring

At startup, [`app/main.py`](../app/main.py) creates a single
`SQLAlchemySkillRegistryRepository`, a shared `GovernancePolicy`, and three
read-side services:

- `SkillDiscoveryService`
- `SkillResolutionService`
- `SkillFetchService`

Those are stored in `app.state` and injected into route handlers through
[`app/core/dependencies.py`](../app/core/dependencies.py). The same dependency
module also authenticates Bearer tokens and turns them into `CallerIdentity`
objects with `read`, `publish`, or `admin` scopes.

### Discovery Flow

1. [`app/interface/api/discovery.py`](../app/interface/api/discovery.py) validates the request DTO and requires a `read` caller.
2. The route calls [`app/core/skill_discovery.py`](../app/core/skill_discovery.py), which converts `{name, description, tags}` into a search query.
3. Discovery reuses [`app/core/skill_search.py`](../app/core/skill_search.py):
   - normalizes text and tags
   - resolves lifecycle/trust-tier filters through [`app/core/governance.py`](../app/core/governance.py)
   - records an audit event
4. The repository executes ranked SQL against the denormalized
   `skill_search_documents` table via
   [`app/persistence/skill_registry_repository.py`](../app/persistence/skill_registry_repository.py)
   and
   [`app/persistence/skill_registry_repository_support.py`](../app/persistence/skill_registry_repository_support.py).

In practice, discovery is an indexed search path over normalized slug, name,
description, tags, lifecycle status, trust tier, publication time, and content
size. Ranking prefers exact slug match, then exact name match, then text rank,
tag overlap, usage count, freshness, and smaller content. The SQL also collapses
multiple versions down to the best candidate per slug before the API returns
only the ordered slug list.

### Resolution Flow

1. [`app/interface/api/resolution.py`](../app/interface/api/resolution.py) validates `slug` and `version` path params and requires `read`.
2. [`app/core/skill_resolution.py`](../app/core/skill_resolution.py) performs one exact lookup through the repository's relationship-read port.
3. The core service enforces exact-read governance for the stored lifecycle status.
4. The response is built by filtering the stored relationship selectors down to
   `depends_on` only.

Resolution is deliberately not a solver. The server does not recurse into
dependencies, choose versions, or expand transitive graphs. It returns the
authored first-degree selectors exactly enough for a client-side solver to make
the next decision.

### Fetch Flow

1. [`app/interface/api/fetch.py`](../app/interface/api/fetch.py) validates `slug` and `version` path params and requires `read`.
2. [`app/core/skill_fetch.py`](../app/core/skill_fetch.py) performs one exact repository lookup for metadata or content.
3. The core service checks exact-read governance on the stored lifecycle status.
4. Missing coordinates raise `SKILL_VERSION_NOT_FOUND`.
5. The route serializes:
   - metadata as the immutable JSON envelope
   - content as raw markdown bytes with immutable cache headers

## Governance Defaults

The built-in default profile currently does this:

- publish:
  - `untrusted`: `publish`
  - `internal`: `publish` plus provenance
  - `verified`: `admin` plus provenance
- discovery visibility:
  - default behavior: `published`
  - `read` callers may explicitly search `published` and `deprecated`
  - `admin` may also search `archived`
- exact reads:
  - `published`: `read`
  - `deprecated`: `read`
  - `archived`: `admin`
