# Milestone 05 Changelog - Metadata Search, Ranking, and Normalized Storage

This changelog documents implementation of [.agents/plans/05-metadata-search-ranking.md](../../.agents/plans/05-metadata-search-ranking.md).

The branch delivered more than indexed search. It also completed the PostgreSQL normalization work described by the milestone, moved exact content fetch onto database-backed markdown storage, and split read surfaces so discovery stays body-free. Supporting design references live in [docs/schema.md](../../docs/schema.md) and [docs/storage-strategy.md](../../docs/storage-strategy.md).

Historical note (March 15, 2026): the route inventory described below predates the contract freeze from Plans 07-09. References to legacy identity/list routes, `GET /discovery/skills/search`, and `POST /resolution/relationships:batch` are transitional history only; the current public contract is documented in [docs/project/api-contract.md](../project/api-contract.md).

## Scope Delivered

- The public HTTP contract now matches the normalized model instead of the legacy manifest-plus-artifact upload shape: [app/interface/api/skills.py](../../app/interface/api/skills.py) publishes `POST /skill-versions`, `GET /skills/{slug}`, and `GET /skills/{slug}/versions`, [app/interface/api/fetch.py](../../app/interface/api/fetch.py) serves exact metadata and raw markdown at `GET /skills/{slug}/versions/{version}` plus `.../content`, [app/interface/api/discovery.py](../../app/interface/api/discovery.py) exposes advisory search at `GET /discovery/skills/search`, and [app/interface/api/resolution.py](../../app/interface/api/resolution.py) exposes direct relationship reads at `POST /resolution/relationships:batch`.
- The schema rollout spans [alembic/versions/0004_metadata_search_ranking.py](https://github.com/y0ncha/Aptitude/blob/70f42c4d1d01f120146f165e058bc86cad1fea85/alembic/versions/0004_metadata_search_ranking.py) and [alembic/versions/0005_normalized_skill_storage_api_cleanup.py](https://github.com/y0ncha/Aptitude/blob/57799f7b92feccbe6fa882060d16cf7d83a56e53/alembic/versions/0005_normalized_skill_storage_api_cleanup.py): `0004` introduced the search read model and ranking indexes, while `0005` adds `skills.slug`, `skills.current_version_id`, lifecycle timestamps/state, creates `skill_contents`, `skill_metadata`, `skill_relationship_selectors`, and `skill_dependencies`, backfills them from legacy rows, and rebuilds `skill_search_documents` from normalized sources.
- The immutable persistence path is now centered on [app/persistence/skill_registry_repository.py](../../app/persistence/skill_registry_repository.py) plus the normalized SQLAlchemy models in [app/persistence/models/skill.py](../../app/persistence/models/skill.py), [app/persistence/models/skill_version.py](../../app/persistence/models/skill_version.py), [app/persistence/models/skill_content.py](../../app/persistence/models/skill_content.py), [app/persistence/models/skill_metadata.py](../../app/persistence/models/skill_metadata.py), [app/persistence/models/skill_relationship_selector.py](../../app/persistence/models/skill_relationship_selector.py), and [app/persistence/models/skill_dependency.py](https://github.com/y0ncha/Aptitude/blob/70f42c4d1d01f120146f165e058bc86cad1fea85/app/persistence/models/skill_dependency.py). Content rows are deduplicated by checksum, version rows remain immutable, authored selectors are preserved in publish order, and exact dependency edges are materialized only when the target `slug@version` is resolvable.
- Search now runs against a normalized derived read model instead of manifest-projected identity fields. [app/persistence/models/skill_search_document.py](../../app/persistence/models/skill_search_document.py), [app/core/skills/search.py](../../app/core/skills/search.py), and [app/intelligence/search_ranking.py](../../app/intelligence/search_ranking.py) implement slug/name/full-text/tag matching, freshness and content-size filters, deterministic tie-breaking, and stable explanation fields (`matched_fields`, `matched_tags`, `reasons`) over body-free search rows.
- The milestone also landed the service split needed to keep query paths explicit: [app/core/skills/registry.py](../../app/core/skills/registry.py) owns publish and identity/list reads, [app/core/skills/fetch.py](../../app/core/skills/fetch.py) owns exact metadata/body reads, [app/core/skill_relationships.py](https://github.com/y0ncha/Aptitude/blob/d121a27441a2f699bd0d3a85fe9127a14c8d820f/app/core/skill_relationships.py) owns direct relationship inspection, and [app/core/dependencies.py](../../app/core/dependencies.py) plus [app/main.py](../../app/main.py) wire those services into the public API contract documented in [docs/api-contract.md](../project/api-contract.md).

    Repo --> SearchDocs["skill_search_documents"]
```

Why this shape:
- PostgreSQL is now the only authoritative store for identity, metadata, relationships, and markdown bodies. The old filesystem-backed artifact path was removed from runtime use, [app/core/skills/fetch.py](../../app/core/skills/fetch.py) reads `skill_contents.raw_markdown` directly, and [app/interface/api/fetch.py](../../app/interface/api/fetch.py) exposes immutable cache headers from the stored checksum.
- Query-path separation is enforced in code instead of documentation only. Discovery and list/search flows stay off the raw markdown table through [app/persistence/models/skill_search_document.py](../../app/persistence/models/skill_search_document.py) and summary projections in [app/core/skills/registry.py](../../app/core/skills/registry.py), while exact content fetch is the only path that loads full markdown bytes through [app/core/skills/fetch.py](../../app/core/skills/fetch.py).

## Design Notes

- The milestone chose PostgreSQL-only storage rather than keeping filesystem-backed artifacts. The migration reads legacy files during backfill and falls back to generated placeholder markdown when a historical artifact is missing, but the steady-state runtime now serves exact content from [app/persistence/models/skill_content.py](../../app/persistence/models/skill_content.py) and [alembic/versions/0005_normalized_skill_storage_api_cleanup.py](https://github.com/y0ncha/Aptitude/blob/57799f7b92feccbe6fa882060d16cf7d83a56e53/alembic/versions/0005_normalized_skill_storage_api_cleanup.py).
- `skill_relationship_selectors` and `skill_dependencies` intentionally coexist. [app/persistence/models/skill_relationship_selector.py](../../app/persistence/models/skill_relationship_selector.py) preserves authored selector text, edge family, order, optionality, and markers exactly as published, while [app/persistence/models/skill_dependency.py](https://github.com/y0ncha/Aptitude/blob/70f42c4d1d01f120146f165e058bc86cad1fea85/app/persistence/models/skill_dependency.py) stores only exact version-to-version edges that can be resolved deterministically during publish or migration backfill.
- Legacy mirrors were retained where they reduce migration and downgrade risk. [app/persistence/models/skill.py](../../app/persistence/models/skill.py) still keeps `skill_id` as an internal compatibility column, and [app/persistence/models/skill_version.py](../../app/persistence/models/skill_version.py) still mirrors `manifest_json` and `artifact_rel_path`, but repository code now treats `slug`, `content_fk`, `metadata_fk`, and `checksum_digest` as the real source model.
- The original search-only framing is no longer sufficient for this milestone. The branch used dedicated discovery, resolution, and fetch services to make the plan’s body-free search and exact-content-read boundaries enforceable at the router and service levels, not just at the SQL level. See [app/main.py](../../app/main.py), [app/core/dependencies.py](../../app/core/dependencies.py), and [tests/unit/test_registry_api_boundary.py](../../tests/unit/test_registry_api_boundary.py).

### `skill_search_documents`

| Field | Type | Nullable | Default / Constraint | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `skill_version_fk` | `bigint` | No | PK, FK to `skill_versions.id`, `ON DELETE CASCADE` | Pins each derived search row to one immutable version so the read model is always rebuildable. |

## Verification Notes

- Migration lifecycle and schema shape are covered by [tests/integration/test_migrations.py](../../tests/integration/test_migrations.py), including explicit 0005 backfill checks for content rows, metadata rows, exact dependency rows, and rebuilt search documents.
- End-to-end API behavior is covered by [tests/integration/test_skill_registry_endpoints.py](../../tests/integration/test_skill_registry_endpoints.py) for normalized publish, identity/list reads, exact metadata fetch, markdown content fetch with immutable cache headers, all relationship edge families, slug-based discovery ranking, invalid dependency constraints, and publish-time search-document projection.
- Pure helper behavior is covered by [tests/unit/test_migration_0005.py](https://github.com/y0ncha/Aptitude/blob/57799f7b92feccbe6fa882060d16cf7d83a56e53/tests/unit/test_migration_0005.py), [tests/unit/test_search_ranking.py](../../tests/unit/test_search_ranking.py), [tests/unit/test_skill_registry_repository.py](../../tests/unit/test_skill_registry_repository.py), [tests/unit/test_skill_registry_service.py](../../tests/unit/test_skill_registry_service.py), and [tests/unit/test_skill_relationship_service.py](https://github.com/y0ncha/Aptitude/blob/86f334779619032d8c1eb6fd8d08221badcc6394/tests/unit/test_skill_relationship_service.py).
- Contract drift is covered by [tests/unit/test_registry_api_boundary.py](../../tests/unit/test_registry_api_boundary.py) and [tests/unit/test_api_contract_examples.py](../../tests/unit/test_api_contract_examples.py), which keep the router surface and example payloads aligned.
- Integration checks still require a reachable PostgreSQL database through [tests/conftest.py](../../tests/conftest.py). This changelog update did not add a database-free end-to-end harness.

## Addendum (2026-03-21)

- Legacy route names in this changelog are preserved as historical delivery context only. That includes `POST /skill-versions`, `GET /skills/{slug}`, `GET /skills/{slug}/versions`, `GET /discovery/skills/search`, and `POST /resolution/relationships:batch`.
- The live public contract is the frozen route set documented in [docs/project/api-contract.md](../project/api-contract.md) and [Plan 09](../../.agents/plans/09-public-api-simplification-and-contract-freeze.md).
